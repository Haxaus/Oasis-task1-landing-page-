        <h2>What is VPN ?</h2>
<p>VPN stands for "Virtual Private Network" and describes the opportunity
to establish a protected network connection when using public networks. 
VPNs encrypt your internet traffic and disguise your online identity. This
 makes it more difficult for third parties to track your activities 
 online and steal data. The encryption takes place in real time.</p>
 <br><br>

 <h2>How does a VPN work?</h2>
 A VPN hides your IP address by letting the network redirect it through a specially configured remote server run by a VPN host. This means that if you surf online with a VPN, the VPN server becomes the source of your data. This means your Internet Service Provider (ISP) and other third parties cannot see which websites you visit or what data you send and receive online. A VPN works like a filter that turns all your data into "gibberish". Even if someone were to get their 
 hands on your data, it would be useless.

 What are the benefits of a VPN connection?
A VPN connection disguises your data traffic online and protects it from external access.
Unencrypted data can be viewed by anyone who has network access and wants to see it.
With a VPN, hackers and cyber criminals can't decipher this data.
Secure encryption: To read the data, you need an encryption key . Without one, it would
take millions of years for a computer to decipher the code in the event of a brute force attac
k . With the help of a VPN, your online activities are hidden even on public networks.
Disguising your whereabouts : VPN servers essentially act as your proxies on the internet.
Because the demographic location data comes from a server in another country, your actual
location cannot be determined. In addition, most VPN services do not store logs of your
activities. Some providers, on the other hand, record your behavior, but do not pass this
information on to third parties. This means that any potential record of your user behavior
remains permanently hidden
<br><br>
<h2>Should you use a VPN connection?</h2><br>
Your ISP usually sets up your connection when you connect to the internet. It tracks you via
an IP address. Your network traffic is routed through your ISP's servers, which can log and
display everything you do online.
Your ISP may seem trustworthy, but it may share your browsing history with advertisers, the
police or government, and/or other third parties. ISPs can also fall victim to attacks by cyber
criminals: If they are hacked, your personal and private data can be compromised.
This is especially important if you regularly connect to public Wi-Fi networks. You never
know who might be monitoring your internet traffic and what they might steal from you,
including passwords, personal data, payment information, or even your entire identity.
What should a good VPN do?
You should rely on your VPN to perform one or more tasks. The VPN itself should also be
protected against compromise. These are the features you should expect from a
comprehensive VPN solution:
Encryption of your IP address: The primary job of a VPN is to hide your IP address from
your ISP and other third parties. This allows you to send and receive information online
without the risk of anyone but you and the VPN provider seeing it.
Encryption of protocols: A VPN should also prevent you from leaving traces, for
example, in the form of your internet history, search history and cookies. The encryption
of cookies is especially important because it prevents third parties from gaining acces
